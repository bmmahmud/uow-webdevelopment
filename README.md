# Web Development @ UOW
Subject work of Web developemnt Spring 2023 at UOW
## Description
While doing Web Development subject for my Master's degree at UOW I did a lot of assignments and 
lab exercises. In this repo, I have organized them for future help.
I learned a basic foundation of Web development and also how to create dynamic web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This subject teaches me how to document 
structured data for Web development, focusing on the two most popular structured data formats: JSON and XML. Now, I can create interactive web applications with AJAX.
